# Cyber Security Internship – Task 2: Phishing Email Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this task is to analyze a suspicious email and identify key phishing indicators. This promotes awareness of common phishing tactics and enhances email threat detection skills.

## Email Summary (Analyzed)

- Subject: High-severity alert: Phish delivered due to tenant or user override  
- From: microsoft@email-records.com  
- Date/Time: 01/22/2021 at 4:22 PM  

The email appears to be from Microsoft, warning the recipient about a security threat. It includes a "View alert details" button and uses Microsoft Office 365 branding to enhance credibility.

## Phishing Indicators Identified

The following phishing characteristics were observed in the email:

| No. | Indicator             | Description |
|-----|------------------------|-------------|
| 1.  | Fake Sender Email      | The sender domain `email-records.com` is not associated with Microsoft. A legitimate Microsoft message would originate from `@microsoft.com`. |
| 2.  | Urgent Tone            | The subject and body use urgency (“high-severity alert”) to provoke immediate action from the recipient. |
| 3.  | Suspicious Button      | The "View alert details" button likely redirects to a phishing website. Hovering over the button would expose a non-Microsoft URL. |
| 4.  | Unclear Details        | The phrase “sent by Unknown to at” is vague and grammatically incorrect, indicating a lack of professionalism. |
| 5.  | No Personalization     | The email does not address the recipient by name, suggesting it was sent in bulk. |
| 6.  | Mimicked Branding      | Microsoft logos and design elements are used to give a false sense of legitimacy, though the email lacks proper verification. |

## Key Concepts Learned

- Recognition of phishing patterns, such as spoofed domains, urgent messages, and generic content.
- Understanding of how social engineering is applied in phishing attacks.
- Importance of verifying sender identities and checking embedded URLs before interacting with emails.
- Awareness that branding alone does not guarantee authenticity.

## Outcome

The analysis helped in identifying the structure and tactics of a phishing email. By evaluating sender details, message tone, and embedded links, it becomes easier to detect fraudulent emails. This exercise contributes to better cybersecurity awareness and preparedness.
